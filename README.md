# TeGere

A Gherkin library for Clojure. The name "te gere" is intended to be a Latin
translation of English "behave!". Modeled after the Python Behave library.

Yes, I do know about [cucumber-jvm](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-jvm)
and [cucumber-js](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js). This is mostly
just for fun. It's especially fun if you're looking for an excuse to use
[Instaparse](https://github.com/Engelberg/instaparse).


## Usage

Run TeGere with Leiningen against the examples directory, which contains sample
Gherkin feature files and step implementations:

    $ lein run examples/

Alternatively, build a JAR and run it against examples/

    $ lein uberjar
    $ java -jar target/uberjar/tegere-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar examples/


## Run the Tests

Use leiningen to run the tests:

    $ lein test
