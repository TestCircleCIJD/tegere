  TeGere
================================================================================

A Gherkin library for Clojure. To "te gere" is to carry oneself with dignity or,
as the vulgar crowd might say, to "behave!".

    "Now, if you have one of these pretend testing systems that lets you write
    English strings so that the customer can look at it, that's just silly."

    -- Rich Hickey (Simple Made Easy talk)

Yes, `cucumber-jvm`_ and `cucumber-js`_ exist. TeGere offers a Clojure-first
Gherkin library and an opportunity to use Instaparse_ to create a useful DSL.
Takes inspiration from `Python Behave`_.


Quickstart
================================================================================

Add the following line to the `:deps` map of your deps.edn::

    tegere
    {:git/url "https://github.com/jrwdunham/tegere"
     :sha "ca46ff34e05123ea3caf2cc438ec3781b96f071c"}}


Usage
================================================================================

Run TeGere with the ``clj`` tool against the examples/ directory, which contains
sample Gherkin feature files and step implementations::

    $ clj -A:run examples/
    2 features passed, 0 failed
    4 scenarios passed, 0 failed
    26 steps passed, 0 failed, 0 untested 

The same can be accomplished with Leiningen::

    $ lein run examples/

Alternatively, build a JAR and run it against examples/::

    $ lein uberjar
    $ java -jar target/uberjar/tegere-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar examples/

Example usage in a Clojure project:

.. code-block:: clojure

       (ns example.core
         (:require [tegere.cli :as tegcli]
                   [tegere.loader :as tegload]
                   [tegere.runner :as tegrun]
                   [tegere.steps :as tegstep]
                   [example.steps.core]))  ;; should register step functions

       (defn main
         [args]
         (let [cli-args (tegcli/simple-cli-parser args)
               config {:tags (select-keys (:kwargs cli-args) [:and-tags :or-tags])
                       :stop (get-in cli-args [:kwargs :stop] false)}
               features (tegload/load-feature-files (-> cli-args :args first))]
           (tegrun/run features @tegstep/registry config)))

       (defn -main
         [& args]
         (println (main args)))


Run the Tests
================================================================================

Use the ``test`` alias defined in ``deps.edn``::

    $ clj -A:test
    
or Leiningen::

    $ lein test
